Run the main.py file

Assumption made is not knowing the number of robots to survey
So the first input will be right co-ordinate of the plateau
Second input is the number of robots
Third inputs onwards its as like in the problem statement, the current co-ordinates
the next input will have the movement

First enter the input of the first robot and then move on to the other robots based on the number of robots

There are 3 files
heading.py file is used to calculate the heading of the robot based on the navigation instruction
movement.py file is used to calculate the new co-ordinate of the robot based on the navigation instruction
main.py is the file which imports both heading and movement files and their functions. It imports the function and call them based on the input.

The problem can be divided into 3 main steps
1st would be to gather the inputs and organize them.
2nd would be to read the navigation accurately based on the inputs i.e calculating the heading and co-ordinate.
3rd would be to gather the output new co-ordinates for each robot.

The problem can also be approached by using other inbuilt methods but dividing it different parts would be better to understand and having different files for their particular task would be easy to edit or make changes if required in the future without effecting the main body.
